## Description
The speed of elementary quantum gates, particularly two-qubit gates, ultimately sets the limit on the speed at which quantum circuits can operate. In this work, we expand our computational system to a qutrit space and leverage our larger space to generate two-qubit gates at much faster speeds. Here, we show for specific two-qubit gates, we can theoretically achieve a 3x speed-up using experimentally feasible coupling regimes, and we prove that this speed-up is maximal for our regime. We accomplish this speed-up by utilizing a machine learning-inspired optimal control method, and our optimal control method also incorporates all error sources, leakage and cross-talk, from single-qudit drives. Using our method, we can nearly saturate our speed-up while accounting for non-instantaneous single-qudit drives and mitigating all controllable error sources. Our method generalizes for all weakly anharmonic systems, and thus our optimal control method is highly applicable for many experimental platforms and would significantly increase circuit depth. 

## Setup
1. Install a Python environment with version 3.7 and pip.
2. Make sure a version of Bash is installed on machine. 
3. Install GitHub repository on local machine. Ex(Linux/Unix): `git install https://github.com/b-basyildiz/QuditML.git`
4. Install required packages through `pip install requirements.txt` while in local environment.
5. All set to run! 

## Use
To run our Optimal Control Protocol, while in the local environment open QOC.bash through `vim QOC.bash`
